In this project, we built a smart sensor device using the RIOT operating system. This device collects information about the environment, like temperature and pressure, and sends it securely to a central hub called an MQTT broker. This broker is set up to connect with AWS IoT, a cloud service. The data collected by the sensor can then be seen and analyzed using Grafana, a tool for visualizing information.
